Core Features & Approach
✅ Automated Subscription Detection

Pull data from bank statements, Apple ID, Google Play, PayPal, Stripe, and emails to identify active subscriptions.
Categorize transactions as recurring vs. one-time to avoid false positives.
✅ Proactive Alerts & Reports

Notify before renewals (X days before, user-defined).
Monthly/quarterly reports summarizing spending trends.
✅ Cancellation Assistance

Identify cancelation steps per service (link to provider or auto-fill requests where possible).
Track free trials & upcoming charges.
✅ Cross-Device Integration

Mobile app (iOS/Android).
Web dashboard for easy access.
✅ Data Privacy & Security

OAuth login for Apple/Google Play access.
Bank API support (like Plaid, TrueLayer for EU/NZ).
End-to-end encryption for transaction parsing.
✅ Smart Categorization

AI-powered name matching to detect subscriptions across different payment platforms.
Group subscriptions into personal, business, entertainment, utilities, SaaS, etc..
✅ Export & Sharing

CSV/PDF exports for finance tracking.
Share reports with family or business partners.
Tech Stack Considerations
🛠 Back-End: Node.js (NestJS) or Django
🛠 Front-End: React Native (for mobile), Next.js (for web)
🛠 Storage: Firebase / Supabase / AWS
🛠 APIs: Plaid, TrueLayer, Gmail API, Apple Subscription API
🛠 AI Matching: OpenAI for transaction classification

Business Model
💰 Freemium

Free for tracking a limited number of subscriptions.
Paid tier for unlimited tracking, AI-enhanced detection, and premium reports.
💰 Bank Integration Upsell

Option for live transaction sync if the user connects their bank (bank APIs have costs, so premium feature?).
💰 Affiliate Commissions

Earn commissions from alternative subscription services (e.g., cheaper software recommendations).
Potential Challenges
❌ Bank API Costs – Plaid & TrueLayer charge per user, so free users might not be viable.
❌ Apple/Google Restrictions – Some data might be locked behind their API policies.
❌ Email Parsing Accuracy – Subscription emails vary in format. Might need AI tuning.

Most apps just half-ass this, relying on manual entry or weak bank connections that miss non-bank subs (Apple, Google Play, PayPal, Stripe, etc.).

This will hit snags, but that’s what makes it fun—breaking past the roadblocks is where the real innovation happens.

How We Roll This Out
We don’t build the whole thing at once. Instead, we:

✅ 1. Prove Subscription Detection Works

Start by parsing bank transactions (mock data first).
Detect recurring charges vs. one-time purchases.
Build basic "Subscription List" from that.
✅ 2. Add More Data Sources

Pull in Gmail API → Scan emails for "subscription renewal" notices.
Check Apple/Google Play purchases (see API access rules).
Sync with PayPal & Stripe for hidden subs.
✅ 3. Build the Alerts System

Notify when renewals are coming (default: 7 days before).
Show how much you’re actually paying per year.
✅ 4. Figure Out the “Cancel” Process

Auto-fill cancellation requests where possible.
Provide direct cancel links (or automate where legal).
Initial Stack
Front-end: React Native (so it’s cross-platform from day one).
Back-end: Node.js (NestJS) or Python (Django/FastAPI).
Data Storage: Firebase/Supabase (fast & scalable).
APIs to Investigate:
Plaid / TrueLayer (Bank transaction data)
Gmail API (Subscription emails)
Apple/Google APIs (App Store purchases)
PayPal/Stripe (for hidden subs)
Where We Might Hit Walls
❌ Bank APIs Cost Money → Might need a free plan with manual entry.
❌ Apple/Google Data Lockdown → If API access is limited, we may have to scrape emails for receipts.
❌ Cancellation Process Might Be a Headache → Some companies make it hell to cancel subs (Amazon, Adobe).

How We Tackle This Without Going Broke
💰 Freemium Model:

Free users get basic tracking (manual entry, limited auto-detection).
Paid users get full automation (bank sync, AI detection, early renewal alerts).
💰 Affiliate Revenue:

Suggest cheaper alternatives (get a commission if they switch).
Offer a "we cancel it for you" service (if legal).
First Steps (Let's Just Get Something Working)
1️⃣ Mock Transaction Parsing – Fake data, detect subs from transactions.
2️⃣ Basic App UI – React Native, display subs list.
3️⃣ Gmail API Check – Can we extract sub renewals from emails?
4️⃣ Bank API Investigation – See if Plaid/TrueLayer are worth it.
